## pxlNav Examples

Please see `./js/pxlNavLoader_basic.js` to see an implementation of pxlNav


Currently, `pxlNav` expects the Room files to a relative path to `pxlnav.###.js` itself.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; By default the same folder as pxlNav, `./pxlRooms`
<br/>From `pxlNavLoader_basic.js`-
```const pxlRoomRootPath = "pxlRooms";```

<br/>`pxlRooms` is the path, loading as `./pxlRooms` 
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Update it as needed, eg: `../pxlRooms`
